AWS Lambda function to cleanup orphaned launch configurations.

## Requirements

The script depends on [boto3](http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  It is provided by AWS lambda at runtime but the library is needed to execute the `upload.py` script locally.

## Installation

Set your AWS token via environment variables:

```bash
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>
```

Run the `upload.py` script to setup IAM roles, policies, and lambda function for execution.

```bash
$ python upload.py launchconfigcleanup
```

## Usage

### Dry Run

A dry run can be executed by setting the `DryRun` attribute to `true`.

```json
{
  "DryRun": true
}
```

See [boto3 EC2 service resources](http://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/services/ec2.html#service-resource) for full documentation of the supported filters.

### Retention

TBD: needs persistent configuration due to lack of tags on launch configurations

## Scheduling

Scheduled execution must be set up manually in the lambda console until boto3 adds support.
